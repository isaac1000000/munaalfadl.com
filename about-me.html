	<p>Muna Al Fadl is a New York City based artist primarily focusing on the destruction
		and reconstruction of memory within the Damascene cityscape.
		Al Fadl’s work overlaps architectural elements, portrait, and image transfer responding to the end of the Assad regime,
		the Syrian Revolution and interrogation regarding nostalgia.
		With the works primarily painted with stain on found woods,
		the fears around post-war reconstruction are the conceptual and physical basis of the work.</p>
	<p>By depicting iconic architectural structure within Damascus architecture,
		Al Fadl is called into the collective and nationalistic memory of the Syrians
		but then fragments the architecture and separates structures from its original context.
		Al Fadl pulls from the lens of the orientalists in order to explore the separation she
		has within her own work. Unnatural lighting, fragmented archways, and image transfer reinforce the
		immediacy and the unknown within the work and current political and social climate for Syria.
		Al Fadl’s work is an ode to uncharted home, a response to the fall of tyranny,
		and a poem to the resilience of the Syrian people.</p>
