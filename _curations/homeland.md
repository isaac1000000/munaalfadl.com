Homeland  الارض في قلبي explores the nuance and beauty of Levantine culture from the perspectives of two Arabs living in diaspora and two Arabs living in their homeland. Muna Al-Fadl, a Syrian-American painter, and Zach Hussein, a Palestinian-American photographer, explore their experience as First-Generation Arab-Americans trying to find connection to their homeland. As they grew up in diaspora, Al-Fadl and Hussein were able to return periodically to their countries of origin to explore deeper connections with their heritage. Baha Sulieman, a Jordanian-Palestinian street photographer, and Khaldon Khalil, a Baghdadi street photographer, dive into daily life and the intense social and political situations of their respective countries. 

This show aims to explore the perspective differences and nuances of young Arab’s appreciation and understanding of Levantine culture through the complex and emotional narratives in a disconnected and fragmented state of mind. With an emphasis on the beauty of Levantine culture from all the artists, the exhibit highlights both the beauty and the strength of the Levantine spirit.
