Horsemarket is an interdisciplinary exploration of contemporary queer art that is taking a look into intimate moments with oneself and the politicization of queer people in 21st century America. As queerness is both politically persecuted and monetized, Horsemarket explores the reactionary queerness of today's young artists. The artists in Horsemarket are creating nuanced, diverse work that rejects the corporatized, capitalized queerness projected on todayâ€™s youth and finds power in their identities and communities. These artists reject the sanitized and trivialized notions of queerness presented to those unfamiliar with the community by both embracing restrained and vulgar visual languages.
